Accessible Blockly Music Game
=============================

This game illustrates how to use Accessible Blockly to create a programming
game for blind users.

Accessible Blockly renders a version of the Blockly toolbox and workspace that
is easily keyboard-navigable. Please note that the game is optimized for the
NVDA screen readers on Firefox for Windows. (We chose to start with this
because it is one of the most robust screen readers, and is compatible with
many more aria tags than other screen readers.)

Please note that deaf users should continue using Blockly over Accessible
Blockly.


Installation
============
This demo depends on the MIDI.js library, which is automatically downloaded via
the Blockly Games Makefile when you run "make deps".

To set it up locally, you will need to run this game on a server (in order for
MIDI.js to work). One way to do this is to navigate to the parent of the
blockly-games folder, and then run:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

Then, navigate to:

    http://localhost:8888/appengine/accessible/index.html
